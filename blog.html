                It's me again! <br>
                I hope you've been doing good. ^_^ <br>
                <br>
                So first let's talk about the open sourcing of this website.<br>
                I know some of you reading this are interested in doing some coding.<br>
                So I thought it might be a good idea to share the code. <br>
                <br>
                This website isn't anything fancy though. Don't expect anything complex. <br>
                But I hope it will inspire other people to start coding! <br> 
                You can find my code here: <a href="https://github.com/CinisSec/AragamiSoft">Github.com/cinissec/aragamisoft</a><br>
                <br>
                Hope you enjoy it!<br>
                <br>

                Hey there! <br>
                <br>
                So, yeah... I'm trying to get back into blogging but this time without<br>
                using Ghost or Wordpress. It kinda feels nice to go back to the more simple<br>
                things. You know sometimes I feel like we just complicate our lives.<br>
                When in the end we could just have a text based website! Don't get <br>
                me wrong I love some good design. But this time is not the time for it.<br>
                <br>
                Besides... did you notice how fast this website was? ^o^
                <br>
                <br>
