                Hey there! <br>
                <br>
                I have been re-organizing the website because of some flow changes. I've
                noticed some issues with the current way I was blogging stuff. I mean it
                was easy for me to blog about stuff because it was mostly some div 
                blocks. I've decided to put all the blogposts in a subdirectory and keep the
                general posts on the home page. The blog page will be an index of
                articles.<br>
                <br>
                I also wanted to share a bit about my adventures using FreeBSD. I recently
                decided to wake up my old laptop from 2011 from it's slumber to try out 
                FreeBSD again. I remember trying it back in 2017-2018 but I was so lost
                coming from a mainly Windows and a slight Linux usage. I mean I was 
                using Arch but I had no idea about what I was doing... chmod 777 anyone? <br>
                <br>
                Anyway the installation of FreeBSD was pretty straight forward but I ended 
                up not configuring my wifi properly. As it was a fresh install I just decided
                to install FreeBSD again and everything worked flawlessly! I must admit I 
                quite enjoy the system and user file separation. I feel like Linux systems 
                can become quite messy if not cared for properly. <br>
                <br>
                Later that day I tried to mount an SMB fileshare on the FreeBSD system 
                and... of course SMB2+ is not officially supported by FreeBSD. My plan
                now is to mount my NAS with NFS but that's a work in progress! <br>
                <br>
                Have a nice day! <br>

                It's me again! <br>
                I hope you've been doing good. ^_^ <br>
                <br>
                So first let's talk about the open sourcing of this website.
                I know some of you reading this are interested in doing some coding.
                So I thought it might be a good idea to share the code. <br>
                <br>
                This website isn't anything fancy though. Don't expect anything complex. 
                But I hope it will inspire other people to start coding! <br>
                You can find my code here: <a

                <br>
                Hope you enjoy it!<br>
                <br>
                xoxo<br>

                Hey there! <br>
                <br>
                So, yeah... I'm trying to get back into blogging but this time without
                using Ghost or Wordpress. It kinda feels nice to go back to the more simple
                things. You know sometimes I feel like we just complicate our lives.
                When in the end we could just have a text based website! Don't get
                me wrong I love some good design. But this time is not the time for it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides... did you notice how fast this website was? ^o^
                <br>
                <br>
                xoxo
